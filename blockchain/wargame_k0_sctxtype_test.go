// Wargame: K0 min-ring-4 floor SC_TX-exemption bypass.
//
// TransactionType is an ATTACKER-CONTROLLED header field (serialized at
// transaction.go:316, not derived from payload structure). The floor
// (transaction_verify.go:334) exempts SC_TX. But process_transaction_sc
// (transaction_execute.go:267) treats SC_TX with empty SCDATA as a NO-OP
// (returns fees, no SC execution). So a ring-2 NORMAL transfer stamped
// SC_TX in the header:
//   1. dodges the floor (SC_TX exempt)
//   2. processes balance identically (NORMAL/SC_TX share the same case)
//   3. needs no SCDATA (empty = no-op)
// => the B1 floor is a paper wall until B2's uses_signer registry closes
//    the SC_TX exemption at consensus.
